    <h1>Ahh, 007. Right on time.</h1>

    <p>M mentioned you were in a spot of bother and needed some rather... low-tech utilities. I've scrounged a few things up from the back of the workshop just for you. Don't look so disappointed; these aren't your grandfather's exploding cigars. Practicality is the name of the game now.</p>

    <h3>First up: a common gargabe bag.</h3>

    <p>What did you expect? An exploding pen? We don't really go for that anymore.</p>
    <p>You might wonder, Q, why would I carry around a garbage bag? You see, the beauty is in the banality. This is such an innocuous item that not even our most paranoid adversaries would suspect it's being used for something clandestine. Simply place your sensitive documents inside and deposit the bag at the specified dead drop location at the appointed time. It's a touch archaic, yes, but isn't that part of your charm?</p>

    <h3>Next, we have this rather charming umbrella.</h3>

    <p>It looks, feels, and functions exactly like any standard umbrella. But should the need arise—and let's hope it doesn't involve the weather—a simple press of this button here, disguised within the handle, deploys a micro-needle from the ferrule, administering a rather potent venom to your unsuspecting target. Discreet, effective, and quite lethal. Do try not to mix it up with a hotel's courtesy umbrella.</p>

    <h3>Finally, for the geographically challenged among us: a button compass.</h3>

    <p>Should you find yourself hopelessly lost in the Gobi or adrift in the Mediterranean with all your fancy electronics compromised, simply tear off the top button from your jacket here. A quick unscrew of the top reveals a miniature, yet perfectly functional, compass. With this little marvel, finding your way back to Queen and country should be a doddle.</p>

    <p>That's all for today, 007. Do try to bring them back in one piece, won't you? Some of these are surprisingly hard to source. Now, off you go; the world won't save itself.</p>
